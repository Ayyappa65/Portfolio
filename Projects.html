        <b>Personal Diary Application</b>
<br><br>
Developed a full-stack Personal Diary Application using Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL to help users securely record 
<br>
their daily thoughts, memories, and important events. The application supports CRUD operations for diary entries, 
<br>
along with time-stamped logs to track user activity over time.
<br><br>
Implemented RESTful APIs for smooth communication between frontend and backend services. Designed an intuitive 
<br>
and user-friendly interface to ensure ease of use for users of all technical levels. Data security and privacy 
<br>
were prioritized with proper validations, structured database schema, and clear exception handling.
<br><br>
Focused on delivering a clean and responsive design, while maintaining backend robustness through modular code, 
<br>
logical layer separation, and efficient data management. The application is optimized for performance, reliability, 
<br>
and scalability, making it a dependable personal journaling tool.
